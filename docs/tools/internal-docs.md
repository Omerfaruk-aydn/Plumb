# Internal documentation tool (`get_internal_docs`)

The `get_internal_docs` tool lets PLUMB access its own technical documentation
to provide more accurate answers about its capabilities and usage.

## Description

This tool is used when PLUMB needs to verify specific details about Gemini CLI's
internal features, built-in commands, or configuration options. It provides
direct access to the Markdown files in the `docs/` directory.

### Arguments

`get_internal_docs` takes one optional argument:

- `path` (string, optional): The relative path to a specific documentation file
  (for example, `reference/commands.md`). If omitted, the tool returns a list of
  all available documentation paths.

## Usage

The `get_internal_docs` tool is used exclusively by PLUMB. You cannot invoke
this tool manually.

When PLUMB uses this tool, it retrieves the content of the requested
documentation file and processes it to answer your question. This ensures that
the information provided by the AI is grounded in the latest project
documentation.

## Behavior

PLUMB uses this tool to ensure technical accuracy:

- **Capability discovery:** If PLUMB is unsure how a feature works, it can
  lookup the corresponding documentation.
- **Reference lookup:** PLUMB can verify slash command sub-commands or specific
  setting names.
- **Self-correction:** PLUMB can use the documentation to correct its
  understanding of PLUMB's system logic.

## Next steps

- Explore the [Command reference](../reference/commands.md) for a detailed guide
  to slash commands.
- See the [Configuration guide](../reference/configuration.md) for settings
  reference.
